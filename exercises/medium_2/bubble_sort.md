# The PEDAC Process

## P: Understanding the Problem

- Establish the rules/ define the boundaries of the problem.
  - Assessing available information.
  - Restate Explicit requirements.
  - Identify Implicit requirements.
- Spend enough time. Don't rush this step.

**Bubble Sort**
Write a function that takes an array as an argument and sorts that array using the bubble sort algorithm described above. The sorting should be done "in-place" â€” that is, the function should mutate the array. You may assume that the array contains at least two elements.

- Explicit requirements:
  - Input: array
  - Output: sorted array
function should mutate the array
array contains at least two elements

- Implicit requirements:
Array can contain integers or strings
Strings must be sorted alphabetically

## E: Examples and Test Cases

- Can confirm/ refute assumptions
- Help to answer questions about implicit requirements
- Act as assertions which help to codify the rules and boundaries

Input:
[5, 3]
[6, 2, 7, 1, 4]
['Sue', 'Pete', 'Alice', 'Tyler', 'Rachel', 'Kim', 'Bonnie']

Output:
[3, 5]
[1, 2, 4, 6, 7]
["Alice", "Bonnie", "Kim", "Pete", "Rachel", "Sue", "Tyler"]

## D: Data Structures

- Help to reason with data logically
- Help interact with data at an implementation level
- Thinking in terms of data structures is part of problem solving process
- Data structures are closely linked with algorithms
  - Set of steps from input to output
    - Involves structuring data in a certain way

Array

## A: Algorithms

- A logical sequence of steps for accomplishing a task or objective
  - Closely linked to data structures
  - Series of steps to structure data to produce the required output
- Stay abstract/ high-level
  - Avoid implementation detail
  - Don't worry about efficiency for now

procedure bubbleSort(A : list of sortable items)
    n := length(A)
    repeat
        swapped := false
        for i := 1 to n-1 inclusive do
            /* if this pair is out of order */
            if A[i-1] > A[i] then
                /* swap them and remember something changed */
                swap(A[i-1], A[i])
                swapped := true
            end if
        end for
    until not swapped
end procedure

## C: Implementing a solution in Code

- Translating solution algorithm to code
- Think about the algorithm in the context of the programming language 
  - Language features/ constraints
  - Characteristics of data structures
  - Built-in functions/ methods
  - Syntax and coding patterns
- Create test cases
- Code with intent

## Final Thoughts

- Not a completely linear process
- Move back and forward between the steps
- Switch from implementation mode to abstract problem solving mode when necessary
- Don't try to problem solve at the code level!

# The PEDAC Process

## P: Understanding the Problem

- Establish the rules/ define the boundaries of the problem.
  - Assessing available information.
  - Restate Explicit requirements.
  - Identify Implicit requirements.
- Spend enough time. Don't rush this step.

**Alphabetical Numbers**
Write a function that takes an array of integers between 0 and 19 and returns an array of those integers sorted based on the English word for each number:

    zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen


Explicit requirements:
- Input: array of numbers
- Output: array of numbers sorted

Implicit requirements:
- Returned array should be of numbers, not strings


## E: Examples and Test Cases

- Can confirm/ refute assumptions
- Help to answer questions about implicit requirements
- Act as assertions which help to codify the rules and boundaries

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19];
[zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen]

Sorted:
[8, 18, 11, 15, 5, 4, 14, 9, 19, 1, 7, 17, 6, 16, 10, 13, 3, 12, 2, 0]

## D: Data Structures

- Help to reason with data logically
- Help interact with data at an implementation level
- Thinking in terms of data structures is part of problem solving process
- Data structures are closely linked with algorithms
  - Set of steps from input to output
    - Involves structuring data in a certain way

arrays and objects for key value pairings

## A: Algorithms

- A logical sequence of steps for accomplishing a task or objective
  - Closely linked to data structures
  - Series of steps to structure data to produce the required output
- Stay abstract/ high-level
  - Avoid implementation detail
  - Don't worry about efficiency for now

1. Create a new array that contains all integer's english words
2. Correlate the english word with it's index
3. Sort based on the english word array
  - 
4. Output the keys for the sorted values
5. Return the resulting sorted number array


## C: Implementing a solution in Code

- Translating solution algorithm to code
- Think about the algorithm in the context of the programming language 
  - Language features/ constraints
  - Characteristics of data structures
  - Built-in functions/ methods
  - Syntax and coding patterns
- Create test cases
- Code with intent


## Final Thoughts

- Not a completely linear process
- Move back and forward between the steps
- Switch from implementation mode to abstract problem solving mode when necessary
- Don't try to problem solve at the code level!

# The PEDAC Process

## P: Understanding the Problem

- Establish the rules/ define the boundaries of the problem.
  - Assessing available information.
  - Restate Explicit requirements.
  - Identify Implicit requirements.
- Spend enough time. Don't rush this step.

**All Substrings**
Write a function that returns a list of all substrings of a string. Order the returned list by where in the string the substring begins. This means that all substrings that start at index position 0 should come first, then all substrings that start at index position 1, and so on. Since multiple substrings will occur at each position, return the substrings at a given index from shortest to longest.

You may (and should) use the leadingSubstrings function you wrote in the previous exercise:

Explicit requirements:
- Input: string
- Output: array
- Each substring should begin with the first letter of the word
- List should be sorted from shortest to longest
- The next line in the array should start with the element at the next index of the array
- List out the substrings preceeding that element

Implicit requirements:


## E: Examples and Test Cases

- Can confirm/ refute assumptions
- Help to answer questions about implicit requirements
- Act as assertions which help to codify the rules and boundaries

Input:
'abcde'

Output:
[ 'a', 'ab', 'abc', 'abcd', 'abcde',
  'b', 'bc', 'bcd', 'bcde',
  'c', 'cd', 'cde',
  'd', 'de',
  'e'
]

## D: Data Structures

- Help to reason with data logically
- Help interact with data at an implementation level
- Thinking in terms of data structures is part of problem solving process
- Data structures are closely linked with algorithms
  - Set of steps from input to output
    - Involves structuring data in a certain way

array

## A: Algorithms

- A logical sequence of steps for accomplishing a task or objective
  - Closely linked to data structures
  - Series of steps to structure data to produce the required output
- Stay abstract/ high-level
  - Avoid implementation detail
  - Don't worry about efficiency for now

1. Create an empty array variable to store the result
2. Iterate over the string
3. For every iteration push the element(s) starting from index 0 to the current iteration number
4. Remove the first element in the array
5. Loop through the string again, pushing the proceeding elements to the result
6. Return result



## C: Implementing a solution in Code

- Translating solution algorithm to code
- Think about the algorithm in the context of the programming language 
  - Language features/ constraints
  - Characteristics of data structures
  - Built-in functions/ methods
  - Syntax and coding patterns
- Create test cases
- Code with intent


## Final Thoughts

- Not a completely linear process
- Move back and forward between the steps
- Switch from implementation mode to abstract problem solving mode when necessary
- Don't try to problem solve at the code level!

# The PEDAC Process

## P: Understanding the Problem

- Establish the rules/ define the boundaries of the problem.
  - Assessing available information.
  - Restate Explicit requirements.
  - Identify Implicit requirements.
- Spend enough time. Don't rush this step.

**Multiply**

Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number, multiply each element in the array by the given number and return a new array.

- Explicit Requirements:
  - Input: array of numbers and an number
  - Output: an array of numbers multiplied by the given number
  - Each number of the array is to be multiplied by the number
  - Don't mutate the original array


## E: Examples and Test Cases

- Can confirm/ refute assumptions
- Help to answer questions about implicit requirements
- Act as assertions which help to codify the rules and boundaries

[1, 4, 3, 7, 2, 6], 3 => [3, 12, 9, 21, 6, 18]


## D: Data Structures

- Help to reason with data logically
- Help interact with data at an implementation level
- Thinking in terms of data structures is part of problem solving process
- Data structures are closely linked with algorithms
  - Set of steps from input to output
    - Involves structuring data in a certain way


## A: Algorithms

- A logical sequence of steps for accomplishing a task or objective
  - Closely linked to data structures
  - Series of steps to structure data to produce the required output
- Stay abstract/ high-level
  - Avoid implementation detail
  - Don't worry about efficiency for now

1. Create an empty array variable to store the result
2. Iterate through the array
3. Multiply each element in the array by the given number
4. Return resulting array


## C: Implementing a solution in Code

- Translating solution algorithm to code
- Think about the algorithm in the context of the programming language 
  - Language features/ constraints
  - Characteristics of data structures
  - Built-in functions/ methods
  - Syntax and coding patterns
- Create test cases
- Code with intent

## Final Thoughts

- Not a completely linear process
- Move back and forward between the steps
- Switch from implementation mode to abstract problem solving mode when necessary
- Don't try to problem solve at the code level!
